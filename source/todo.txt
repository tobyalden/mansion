Eirena: Hello, Aira.
Aira: Hi Mom.
Eirena: Have you been well? It's been too long.
Aira: I'm all right. I'm here for the crown.
Eirena: Do you really mean that? You know what that would mean for your grandfather - for the whole family.
Aira: Mom, why did you let him give me a sorcerer's mark? Your own has caused so much pain...
Eirena: It's tradition, Aira. It's our birthright. Can you only see the bad in it? Can't you see all its brought you, as well?
Aira: The bad doesn't balance out the good, Mom. It taints it.
Eirena: Aria...
Aira: You know, I think you only say that because you don't want to face that pain yourself. That's why you let him do it - to prove to yourself it was okay. That what he did to you wasn't so bad.
Eirena: I don't know what to say to that. We see things differently.
Aira: I see clearly. I'm sorry it had to come to this.
Eirena: I as well. Prepare yourself, daughter.

Duessa: Well, the rebel child makes her appearance.
Aira: Aunt Duessa. How have you been.
Duessa: Cut the chat, Aira. I've been around a lot longer than you, and I can say what you're doing right now is pointless and selfish.
Aira: Maybe the point is to be selfish for once.
Duessa: Oh, it wouldn't be the first time. You've been a nasty little self-centered bitch since you popped out looking like a shriveled grape.
Aira: Have you been drinking?
Duessa: Oh, fuck off! You're an embarassment to this whole family!
Aira: Jesus. Can we just fight already?
